# SatelliteTracker

![Satellite tracker CI/CD](https://github.com/jboellaard/SatelliteTracker/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

This application was made for the courses 'Clientside web frameworks' and 'No-SQL databases' at Avans University of Applied Sciences in Breda.

It is deployed at [satellitetracker.netlify.app](https://satellitetracker.netlify.app), for more information see [the about page](https://satellitetracker.netlify.app/about).

Recommended created satellites to view are: [Mars](https://satellitetracker.netlify.app/users/planetary/satellites/642357b4faf3b4a60b7b844d), [Comet](https://satellitetracker.netlify.app/users/joy/satellites/6403c6169f0cc1a3573452a7) and lastly [The International Space Station](https://satellitetracker.netlify.app/users/joy/satellites/63d29e43aa4e8d25639daf60) for a more realistic orbit.
Don't forget to turn off the real size for the latter two, as these are otherwise too small to be seen in the visualization.
